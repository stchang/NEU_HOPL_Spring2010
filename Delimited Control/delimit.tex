%\subsection*{Abstract}
%Continuations, when available as first-class objects, provide a general control abstraction in programming languages. They liberate the programmer from specific control structures, increasing programming language extensibility. Such continuations may be extended by embedding them in functional objects. This technique is first used to restore a fluid environment when a continuation object is invoked. We then consider techniques for constraining the power of continuations in the interest of security and efficiency. Domain mechanisms, which create dynamic barriers for enclosing control, are implemented using fluids. Domains are then used to implement an unwind-protect facility in the presence of first-class continuations. Finally, we demonstrate two mechanisms, wind-unwind and dynamic-wind, that generalize unwind-protect.

\subsection*{Summary}

Haynes and Friedman show how to extend continuations and call/cc by first capturing the continuation provided by call/cc in another lambda, which they call a ``continuation object (cob)'', before passing the cob to call/cc's argument. Capturing the continuation in a cob allows greater flexibility because additional operations can be performed before the continuation is invoked. Haynes and Friedman then present several useful programs that utilize cobs and call/cc variations implemented using cobs, with each program building on the previous one. 

First, cobs are used to implement fluid environments (dynamic binding), which are used to implement dynamic domains, which are finally used to implement \texttt{dynamic-wind}. The \texttt{dynamic-wind} operator is used when a programmer wants to guarantee that certain operations are executed when a specified block of code is entered and exited. One application of \texttt{dynamic-wind} is to ensure that file streams are always properly closed when they are no longer needed.

\subsection*{Analysis}

The primary conclusion of the paper is that continuations provided by call/cc must be properly harnessed and constrained in order to be useful. In the paper, cobs are used to accomplish this. However, the programs presented in the paper are rather inelegant and inefficient. The authors allude to this when they say that the paper ``emphasized semantics, while ignoring some security and efficiency issues.'' The more general problem seems to be that call/cc is ``too powerful'' because most applications do not need the entire rest of the program. A better control operator should give the programmer finer-grained access to a program's context.

%\subsection*{Abstract}
%An analysis of the $\lambda_v$-C-calculus and its problematic relationship to operational equivalence leads to a new control facility: the prompt-application. With the introduction of prompt-applications, the control calculus becomes a traditional calculus all of whose equations imply operational equivalence. In addition, prompt-applications enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of the language. We illustrate the latter claim with examples from such distinct areas as systems programming and tree processing.

\subsection*{Summary}
It has been previously argued that call/cc does not give the programmer complete control over the program because it aborts the current continuation when the captured continuation is invoked~\cite{Felleisen1987SyntacticTheory}. To address this, Felleisen introduces the $\F$ operator, which is a variation of call/cc. $\F$ differs from call/cc in two ways. The first is that an application of $\F$ aborts the current continuation while an application of call/cc does not. Secondly, unlike call/cc, the continuations captured by $\F$ do not abort the current continuation when invoked. This gives the programmer finer-grained control over the continuation because continuations can be invoked multiple times, as well as composed. The $\F$ operator was previously introduced in Felleisen's $\lamdavC$ calculus.

The problem with the $\lamdavC$ calculus is that an evaluator based on the calculus does not obey operational equivalence. To address this problem, Felleisen adds a first class prompt (\#) operator to the calculus that delimits the extent of the continuation captured by the $\F$ operator. With the prompt, expressions that are equal in the calculus behave equivalently in all contexts. Felleisen then derives an abstract machine from the new calculus, and also presents several programming applications of prompts, including a much simpler implementation of the \texttt{dynamic-wind} operator of Haynes and Friedman.

\subsection*{Analysis}

It seems that the initial motivation for adding first-class prompts to the calculus was to fix operational equivalence, and it wasn't discovered until afterwards that prompts could be a useful programming construct. The primary benefit of the $\F$ and prompt operators is that control can be constrained, but another benefit (compared to an operator like call/cc) is that captured continuations can be composed. Perhaps this is implied (because an invocation of a continuation in the abstract machine is just a stack append) but this does not seem to be explicitly stated.

\subsection*{Abstract}
Since control operators for the \textit{unrestricted} transfer of control are too powerful in many situations, we propose the \textit{control delimiter} as a means for restricting control manipulations and study its use in Lisp- and Scheme-like languages. In a Common Lisp-like setting, the concept of delimiting control provides a well-suited terminology for explaining different control constructs. For higher-order languages like Scheme, the control delimiter is the means for embedding Lisp control constructs faithfully and for realizing high-level control abstractions elegantly. A deeper analysis of the examples suggests a need for an entire \textit{control hierarchy} of such delimiters. We show how to implement such a hierarchy on top of the simple version of a control delimiter.

\subsection*{Abstract}
The last few years have seen a renewed interest in continuations for expressing advanced control structures in programming languages, and new models such as Abstract Continuations have been proposed to capture these dimensions. This article investigates an alternative formulation, exploiting the latent expressive power of the standard continuation-passing style (CPS) instead of introducing yet other new concepts. We build on a single foundation: abstracting control as a \textit{hierarchy} of continuations, each one modeling a specific language feature as acting on nested \textit{evaluation contexts}. 

We show how \textit{iterating} the continuation-passing conversion allows us to specify a wide range of control behavior. For example, two conversions yield an abstraction of Prolog-style backtracking. A number of other constructs can likewise be expressed in this framework; each is defined independently of the others, but all are arranged in a hierarchy making any interactions between them explicit. 

This approach preserves all the traditional results about CPS, e.g., its evaluation order independence. Accordingly, our semantics is directly implementable in a call-by-value language such as Scheme or ML. Furthermore, because the control operators denote simple, typable lambda-terms in CPS, they themselves can be statically typed. Contrary to intuition, the iterated CPS transformation does not yield huge results: except where explicitly needed, all continuations beyond the first one disappear due to the extensionality principle ($\eta$-reduction). 

Besides presenting a new motivation for control operators, this paper also describes an improved conversion into applicative-order CPS. The conversion operates in one pass by performing all administrative reductions at translation time; interestingly, it can be expressed very concisely using the new control operators. The paper also presents some examples of nondeterministic programming in direct style.
